# Northwind-AspNet-Core
Business system demo based on the northwind database

Using the northwind database as a starting point (its old but it has one of everything) migrate it to code-first EF.

Eventually there will be a full implementation of the database, an api, shopping basket & back office functions.

More importantly documentation as each element represents real-world challenges.

Its in an early stage at the moment so there is no documentation...

To get it working using SQL server or SQL server express:
1 - Run the script in Resources/instnwd2005_original.sql to create the database and seed data.
2 - Open the project and replace all instances of [server]\\[instance] with the server and instance details for your database.

The ShinyAndNewBranch is for trying out front-end-frameworks.

A copy of the Northwind database and the base .Net Core 2.2 web application is all that is included.
