# Northwind-AspNet-Core
Business system demo based on the northwind database

Using the northwind database as a starting point (its old but it has one of everything) migrate it to code-first EF.

Eventually there will be a full implementation of the database, an api, shopping basket & back office functions.

More importantly documentation as each element represents real-world challenges.

Its in an early stage at the moment so there is no documentation...
